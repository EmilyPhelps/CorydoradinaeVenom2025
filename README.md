## Venom gene expression and potency reveal nature of mimetic relationships in Corydoradinae catfishes

This repository contains the analysis associated with the currently unpublished Phelps _et al._ work. The scripts were written to function on the 
University of East Anglia HPC system as well as a group specific linux, but hopefully can be adapted to other projects.

If you are interested in hearing more about this work or have questions please email Emily Phelps at e.c.phelps@exeter.ac.uk.

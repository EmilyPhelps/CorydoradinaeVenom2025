This repository contains the analysis associated with the currently unpublished Phelps _et al._ work. 
The scripts were written to function on the University of East Anglia HPC system as well as a group 
specific linux, but hopefully can be adapted to other projects.

#Notes to me:
- Have run flash on untrimmed- run on thhe trimmed seq to see if it is only combining reads based on adapters- run interleaved this time
- Estimating raw read length- Estimate the trimmed length
- Think about how to combine.
